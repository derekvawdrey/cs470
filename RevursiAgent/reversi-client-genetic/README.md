# cs-470-reversi-python-client

This is a Python 3 Client for the BYU CS 470 Reversi Lab, with some modifications to the original code. bots are now genetic and weights need to be specified when running the clients.

For instance:

```
python reversi_python_client.py localhost 1 4 -0.9724278637348411 -0.9575917958507336 0.49051641446111605 -0.11043431912527724 0.9305262003315051 0.005978367003628637 
```

will run the first client with the weights specified.
